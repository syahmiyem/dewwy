# Dewwy - Offline Pet Robot

## Introduction
Dewwy is an autonomous pet robot built with a hybrid Raspberry Pi and Arduino architecture. 
It's designed to behave like a real pet with unique personality traits, emotions, and
autonomous movement. Unlike cloud-based robots, Dewwy operates completely offline, 
ensuring privacy and consistent operation without internet dependency.

## Current Features

### Personality System
- Unique personality generation with randomized traits:
  * Openness (curiosity level)
  * Friendliness (interaction style)
  * Activeness (movement frequency)
  * Expressiveness (emotion intensity)
  * Patience (reaction to obstacles/interruptions)
- Persistent memory of interactions and experiences
- Emotion states: happy, sad, excited, neutral, sleepy, curious, scared, playful, grumpy
- Random mood changes based on personality traits

### Pet-like Behaviors
- Autonomous movement with realistic pet-like patterns
- States similar to a real pet: idle, roaming, avoiding, searching, sleeping, playing
- Gets startled by sudden obstacles
- Shows curiosity about surroundings
- Fidgets when idle (like a pet shifting position)
- Gets bored over time and seeks play
- Gets tired after activity and needs to sleep
- "Breathing" movements during sleep state

### Navigation & Movement
- Advanced Roomba-style obstacle avoidance:
  * 3-step avoidance: back away, turn, move forward
  * Smart direction selection based on environment
  * Stuck detection and recovery
- Border detection to avoid falling off edges
- Different movement patterns based on emotional state
- Adjustable movement speed and turning rates

### Hardware Integration
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection
- TB6612FNG motor driver for precise movement control
- OLED display for facial expressions
- Arduino for real-time control of sensors and motors
- Raspberry Pi for higher-level intelligence and decision making

### Simulation Environment
- Arcade-based graphical simulator for testing and demonstration
- Visualized emotions on simulated OLED display
- Dashboard showing system metrics (battery, CPU, temperature)
- Serial communication monitor
- Virtual sensor readings and motor controls

### Learning & Memory
- SQLite database for storing interaction history
- Learning system that builds confidence in responses over time
- Remembers past interactions and emotional states
- Adapts behavior based on experience

### Software Architecture
- Component-based design for modularity
- State machine for behavior control
- Clean separation between hardware and simulation
- Comprehensive testing framework

## Upcoming Features

### Voice Recognition
- Offline speech recognition for basic commands
- Name recognition and response
- Voice-based interactions

### Vision Processing
- Basic object recognition using a camera
- Face detection for human interaction
- Color and motion tracking

### Extended Behaviors
- More complex play behaviors
- Trick learning and performance
- Schedule awareness (day/night cycles)
- Improved human interaction patterns

### Multiple Robot Interaction
- Recognition of other Dewwy robots
- Social behaviors between robots
- Synchronized activities

### Customization Interface
- Web-based dashboard for personality adjustment
- Upload custom expressions and behaviors
- Activity and interaction logs

### Physical Enhancements
- 3D printable chassis designs
- Additional sensor support (touch, light, sound)
- Expansion capabilities for advanced users
